                    <p>Osso Buco stuffing recipes are endlessly customizable. All you have to do is change up the
                        bread,
                        the
                        herbs, and/or the liquid. But if a classic recipe is what you’re after, you’ve found it,
                        though
                        even
                        this one can be tweaked for your taste. For a less rich stuffing, omit the last 4 Tbs. of
                        melted
                        butter and add a bit more stock.

                    <p>Everyone needs to have a go-to recipe for Italian Silky tomato soup.talian Silky tomato soup is
                        like the little black dress of soups. Unadorned and paired with a
                        grilled
                        cheese
                        sandwich, it’s a comforting lunch. Dressed up with simple garnishes, it makes a
                        sophisticated
                        start
                        to a dinner party. You’ll agree after trying this recipe for yourself!</p>

                    <h2><span class="recipie-color">Cabbage Rolls</span></h2>
                    <p>While it would be unfair to say that this is the risotto after which all others are
                        derived—the
                        Venetians provide plenty of competition—its lovely simplicity is hard to match. If you’re
                        uneasy
                        about risotto, this is a good recipe to start with because it’s simple and requires so few
                        ingredients. You’ll agree after trying this recipe for yourself!</p>
